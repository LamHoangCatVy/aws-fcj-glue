## What is the data integration engine supported by AWS Glue?
### AWS Glue for Apache Spark
Apache Spark is an open-source distributed framework that makes it possible to write transformations for batch and streaming data in Python and Scala. With Spark SQL, developers can write SQL-like queries on big data. Apache Spark also provides ML libraries that run in distributed platforms.

### AWS Glue for Python
AWS Glue for Python gives analytics users a Python shell environment to run their Python scripts with the latest Python version

### AWS Glue for Ray
Ray (ray.io) is a new open-source compute framework that helps you scale Python workloads. AWS Glue for Ray facilitates the distributed processing of Python code over multi-node clusters. Users can create and run Ray jobs without trying to learn any big-data framework. Ray is a popular tool being used to parallelize complex transformations that are  common among ML workloads.
